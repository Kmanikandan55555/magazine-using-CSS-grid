          Seoul, the capital of South Korea, pulsates with vibrant energy, seamlessly blending ancient traditions with modern innovations. Its bustling streets are adorned with towering skyscrapers, bustling markets, and serene temples, showcasing a dynamic urban landscape.

          Nestled along the banks of the Han River, Seoul boasts a rich history dating back over two millennia. Visitors can explore historic landmarks like Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace, marveling at their exquisite architecture and cultural significance.

          just occurred to me while I was going for a run. The revelation: the entire curriculum should be a series of projects. Instead of individual coding challenges, we'll just have projects, each with their own seamless series of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure out how to get it to pass. (And you can view hints if that isn't enough.)
